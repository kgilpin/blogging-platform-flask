Create Registration and Login Forms:

Create a Python file (e.g., forms.py) to define your user registration and login forms.

4. Implement Registration and Login Routes:

Create routes for user registration and login within your app.py file. You can place these routes just below the User model definition.

5. Protect Routes with @login_required:

Add @login_required decorators to any routes that require authentication. Place these decorators directly above the route functions in your app.py file.

6. Create Templates for Registration and Login:

In your project's templates directory, create HTML templates for the registration and login forms (e.g., register.html and login.html).

7. Implement a User Loader Function:

Below the code for your routes, define the user loader function. You can place this function in your app.py file.

8. Handle Logout:

Create a logout route in your app.py file to log users out of the application.

9. Use Flask-Login in Templates:

In your HTML templates, you can use Flask-Login to check if a user is logged in and display content accordingly.

By organizing your code in this way, you can keep related functionality (models, forms, routes, templates) in separate files, making your codebase more organized and maintainable.
